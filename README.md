# Identifying regions with different DNA methylation states of homologous chromosomes using Oxford Nanopore reads  

## Description  

Just as single nucleotides, methylation levels may vary on two homologous chromosomes. In nanopore sequencing, electrolytic current signals are sensitive to base modifications, such as 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), so we can determinate methylated positions.   
The purpose of this study is providing a pipeline to identify areas with varying methylation status on different haplotypes.
